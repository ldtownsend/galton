### Full Rewrite

I've decided that I need to fully rewrite the **Tetlock** project. The application has become a bit unweildly and I want to build it with a better code and data structure. The value created from the first draft is primarily in the data collected, not in the code being used. I want to make a serious attempt at building the application with OOP rather than just a series of functions.

I also need to structure the data better and actually use a database for storage rather than just large parquet files functioning as a pseudo database. This issue would have come to a head in the very near future and I was going to need to replace a substantial portion of the data I've been collecting.

I believe the target go-live date of 9/30/2025 will be more achieveable with this rewrite rather than being a cause for delay. Over the next two weeks we'll see if this assumption proves to be just another example of the classic engineer's overconfidence or a wise decision.
